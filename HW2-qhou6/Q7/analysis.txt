Ease to develop for developers 
	from hard to easy: D3 -> Tableau -> Excel 
	D3 requires a great amount of knowledge of front-end development while Tableau and Excel is easy to learn by the general public
Ease to maintain the visualization for developers 
	from hard to easy: D3 -> Tableau -> Excel 
	If product requirement or data get changed, work is required with all three type of visualization tools. However, Tableau and Excel won't be affected a lot by the platform change. 
Usability of visualization developed for end users
	Tableau and Excel typically produce a graph and give users limited amount of interactions. However, D3 can be used to produce really user-friendly visualization with good design.
Scalability of visualization to “large” datasets
	from bad to good: Excel -> Tableau -> D3
	Excel will be really slow when data set is large. Tableau provides developers different platforms to host data, which can be fast to deal with large data set. D3 is the most flexible tool and developers can easily host large datasets.
System requirements to run the visualization for end users
	visualizations developed by all the three tools can be eaily accessible by end users.
